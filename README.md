# padurarbot
A python bot (w discord API). You may see a crappy local json database, ignore it

Bot's main language: Romanian

## Why is everything in the "pad" folder:
Good question. I run the bot on my linux server directly from the "pad" folder.

If you'll ever run the bot on a server, it may not work as intended. The files are made to work in the "root/pad/.file", it can be easily changed to "./file". Laziness
